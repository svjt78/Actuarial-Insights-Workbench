## Actuarial Insights Workbench – Vision

### Purpose
The Actuarial Insights Workbench aims to modernize actuarial, underwriting, and analytics workflows by providing a unified, cloud-ready, ML-enabled platform.

- Unify underwriting and actuarial insights into a single experience.
- Embed ML/AI models with strong governance.
- Serve as a foundation for accelerating Quote-Bind-Issue (QBI) and Cyber underwriting analytics.
- Enable scalable cloud deployment and MLOps maturity.

### Future-State Capabilities
- Real-time loss development monitoring.
- Predictive pricing & LR forecasting.
- Explainable AI for Underwriters & Actuaries.
- Portfolio-level and segment-level profitability insights.
- Integration with enterprise data platforms.
